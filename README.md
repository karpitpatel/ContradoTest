1. I have cretaed a basic framework for this app. From the structure point of view Api.Domain, Api, Web.Domain and Web projects are yet to be complete.
2. I have used Ninject as an IoC container for injecting any kind of dependency within a InjectionConfiguration file for each project.
3. Repositoy and UOW pattern is completely implmented.
4. At some places I have written code as an anti-pattern.
